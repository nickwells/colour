/*
makeReverseColourMap generates a map from a colour to one or more colour
names.

Note that this does not use the standard param package. This is to avoid the
module requiring all the standard modules when the core behaviour does not
need any of them.

The file to be populated is passed as the first parameter with no leading
flag.
